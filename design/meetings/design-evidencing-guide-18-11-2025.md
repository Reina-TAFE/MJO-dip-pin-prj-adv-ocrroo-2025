# Overview

As part of the project, you are required to evidence that you have **designed** an advanced user interface that is fit for purpose.

The following guide will help you ensure that you have met the evidencing requirements while ensuring that you can work in an agile/iterative way that is appropriate for the project and modern software development practices.

## Design Evidencing

Modern design approaches are lightweight and combine iterations with user feedback. This is in contrast to traditional design approaches that are heavy on documentation and require a lot of up-front work.

However, often we cannot access the user in the frequency that allows rapid iteration. One way to mitigate this is to develop personas and scenarios that represent the user and their goals. 

### Minimum Requirements

1. In your project repository, create a folder called `design`.
2. In the `design` folder, create a file called `persona.md` that describes a representative persona
3. Create a subfolder with any design artefacts you created: wireframes, sketches, mockups, etc.]
4. Create at least three github issues related to the design of the application:
   1. Tag each issue with ui-design
   2. Assign each issue to a team member (when  one is allocated)
   3. Include a user story in the format "As a [persona], I want to [goal], so that [reason]"
   4. Add any non-functional requirements as notes in the issue
5. Copy this document into your project and answer any relevant questions

## Personas

A persona is a fictional character that represents a user. It is a way to describe the user's goals, needs, and behaviors. They are focused on **empathy** and **understanding** the user, not demographics, and not a collection of features.

> Describe the key persona your team is focused on implementing the design. You can describe the persona in a file called `persona.md` in the `design` folder.
>


### Persona Template

This is an optional template for how to structure your persona:

```markdown
# Persona: [Persona Name]

## Background
Give the person's background - make sure we can understand their level of skills, knowledge, and experience.

## Goals
Why does this person use the application? What are they trying to achieve?

## Needs
What does this person need from the application? What are their pain points?

```

### Relevant issue
>
> Link to an issue that covers a pain point relevant to the persona and explain why it is relevant.
>

### Validation

You will validate your design by meeting with a user representative: the product owner (in this case, your lecturer).

##### Meeting minutes

- [ ] Meeting held on [18-11-2025]
- [ ] Persona discussed: [Bill]
- [ ] Design artefacts reviewed: [functional protoype]
- [ ] Issues discussed: [video selection (preferably with details e.g. description of content), ]
- [ ] Feedback provided: [clean, easy to navigate(with keyboard) interface, weird that you can't use spacebar to activate button, video position doesn't persist, personalization options]

##### What worked well

- [ ] [well defined vision of product, taken user behaviour patterns into account, see feedback above]

##### What could be improved

- [ ] [see issues and feedback]

##### What will you change before the next meeting

- [ ] landing page for video selection, bookmarks (personalization) (no commitment to complete this)

##### Were there any questions that needed to be discussed with the user

- [ ] is radio buttons suitable for keyboard navigation.

#### Lecturer's checklist (to be used by the lecturer)

- [x] Persona is well defined
- [x] Persona is relevant to the application
- [x] Design artifacts are present and easy to follow
- [x] Design decisions are based on user needs and goals
- [x] Appropriate considerations of interaction patterns appropriate for the user
- [x] Efforts towards realizing at least one significant issue involving user interaction
- [No] Whole team engagement in the design process
